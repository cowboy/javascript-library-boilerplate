_"Roll your own"_

## Modification instructions

Fork the repo. Change the `name` and `$` function. And rename the .js file. And change any references to `QSA` or `qsa` to your new name. And edit the unit tests. And document everything. Or just use [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

## Comparison with other solutions (the test focuses on the length of the selection function)
