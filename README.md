# JavaScript Library Boilerplate

<http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-library-boilerplate/>

Why go through the tedium of creating both a closure AND a `.noConflict` method when all you want to do is create your own JavaScript Library? With [JavaScript Library Boilerplate][project], you can hit the ground running and create your own JavaScript Library in no time!

[project]: http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-library-boilerplate/

## Getting Started

Fork the repo. Change the `name` and `$` function. And rename the .js files. And change all references to `QSA` or `qsa` to your new name. And edit the unit tests. And document everything. Or just use [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

More complete instructions are available at the [project page][project].

## QSA

For more information on the included blazingly-fast 0.3kb QSA css selector library, visit the [project page][project].

## Comparison with other solutions (the test focuses on the length of the selector function)
